I'm an MD/PhD student. I've completed the first two years of medical school, and this is my first year in the PhD program. I'm interested in endocrinology, and I work with Dr. Mohan at the VA hospital. I did my undergraduate work at Biola University, majoring in biochemistry and minoring in math. Ideally I would like to stay in academia, and I really like the idea of teaching, but whatever I end up doing will be research-oriented and directed by clinical experience. I have a little coding experience (C++, Matlab, and R), but I definitely have more experience with math and statistics. I hope to learn a lot of new skills in this class; I'm a little apprehensive, and I expect this class will be a lot of work but a lot of fun as well.
